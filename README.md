## üìñ Usage Guide

``` Directory Shortcuts

The core of `hop2` is making directory navigation instant.

```bash
# Go to a deep directory and save it with an alias
cd ~/work/projects/backend/api/controllers
hop2 add controllers

# Go to another project
cd ~/work/dev/company/products/web/frontend/src/components/shared/buttons
hop2 add buttons

# Now, from anywhere, hop back instantly using the 'h' command
cd ~
h controllers  # You are now in the backend controllers directory
h buttons      # You are now in the frontend buttons directory
```

``` Command Shortcuts

Stop typing long commands over and over.

```bash
# Create an alias for a complex git log command
hop2 cmd glog "git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate"

# Use it anywhere
h my-project-repo
hop2 glog

# Create an alias to find the 10 largest files
hop2 cmd bigfiles "find . -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -nr | head -n 10"
hop2 bigfiles
```

``` Managing Your Shortcuts

-   **List all shortcuts:** See everything you've saved with a clean, formatted table.
    ```bash
    hop2 list
    ```
-   **Remove a shortcut:**
    ```bash
    hop2 rm buttons
    ```

``` Updating & Uninstalling

-   **Update to the latest version:**
    ```bash
    hop2 --update
    ```
-   **Uninstall `hop2` completely:** This removes the executable, all data, and cleans up your shell configuration file automatically.
    ```bash
    hop2 --uninstall
    ```
